# #1. GitHub, JavaScript, and TypeScript Setup

Welcome! We'll start with some JavaScript and TypeScript exercises.

Before we begin, let's make sure these dependencies are installed

1. ## Set up developer environment and GitHub
- Check out these slides here: [GitHub Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BPgH2g_OatKV_dP0hOdubhH43XgD8t7Ibq9y_SuzFMs/edit?usp=sharing)

2. ## Install node.js if needed
You can check if it is installed with these commands

```bash
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```

If it says a command cannot be found, then download node.js with this link here: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

3. ## Install TypeScript

Globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

4. ## Start working on the JavaScript exercises
- Navigate to ```0-JavaScript```, and start working on the exercises in ```main.js ```

5. ## Start working on the TypeScript exercises
- Navigate to ```1-TypeScript```, and start working on the exercises in ```main.ts ```
- Notice how you can **typecast** variables, function parameters, and function return types
